		Ideas from Luke Adam
			1. There are a bunch of things we can do to improve the copy/zip/tar tasks:
				- Add some way to control the character encoding for text files.
				- Add a better way to expand tokens in text files as they are copied.
				- Add support for symlinks.
				- Add a way to rename directories when they are copied (you can already do this for files).
				- There are a few bugs that would be good to fix.
			2. There is a more stuff we can do in reporting:
				- Improve the build dashboard report to show more things, eg the projects in the build, test results, etc.
				- Improve the HTML test report to show the output for a test with that test. At the moment the output is shown per class.
			3. Add something to the JaCoCo plugin to enforce minimum coverage levels.
			4. Add support for Webdav and/or SFTP artefact repositories.

		
		
		Dear Guillaume.
  My name is Anderson, I am a Brazilian software Engineer who lives in Sydney/Australia.
  I have worked with grade for some months and would like to offer a contribution.    I have a extensive experience in java development, however I am new at open source development world and I still don't know exactly what to do and how to begin.

  I downloaded the source from github and I am already working in my personal version, also I entered in http://xircles.codehaus.org/ to look at the issues to understand how it works.

  I would be very happy if I can understand better the process of contribution to help the development of this magnificent language.  I would be very grateful if you helpme somehow to enter in this world passing some intruction or small tasks to do.

  
  Cheers. 
  Anderson.
